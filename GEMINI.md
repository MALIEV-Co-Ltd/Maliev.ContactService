# Maliev.MessageService Migration to .NET 9

This document summarizes the key changes and rationale behind the migration of the `Maliev.MessageService` project to .NET 9, incorporating best practices for API development and deployment.

## Key Changes Made

*   **Target Framework Update**: Migrated all projects (`Maliev.MessageService.Api`, `Maliev.MessageService.Data`, `Maliev.MessageService.Tests`) to `net9.0`.
*   **API Controller Refinement**:
    *   Introduced **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)** (`MessageDto`, `CreateMessageRequest`, `UpdateMessageRequest`, `PaginatedListDto`, `MessageSortType`) for clear API contracts and robust input validation using `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations`.
    *   Implemented a **Service Layer** (`IMessageService`, `MessageService`) to encapsulate business logic, separating concerns from the controller.
    *   Ensured all API operations are asynchronous (`async/await`).
*   **Project File (`.csproj`) Cleanup**:
    *   Added `GenerateDocumentationFile` and `NoWarn` properties to enable XML documentation generation and suppress warnings for missing XML comments.
    *   Added `required` keyword to properties in DTOs and entities to enforce initialization and resolve `CS8618` warnings.
    *   Added necessary NuGet packages: `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore`, `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory`, `Moq`.
*   **Configuration Management**:
    *   Removed sensitive information (connection strings) from `appsettings.json` and `appsettings.Development.json`.
    *   Updated `launchSettings.json` to configure local development, including setting `launchUrl` to the Swagger UI page.
    *   Configured `Program.cs` for dependency injection of `MessageContext` and `IMessageService`.
*   **Boilerplate Cleanup**: Removed all traces of 'WeatherForecast' boilerplate code.
*   **Test Project Refactoring**:
    *   Migrated xUnit tests to the new `Maliev.MessageService.Tests` project.
    *   Refactored tests to use mocked `IMessageService` instead of direct `DbContext` interaction, improving test isolation and maintainability.
    *   Updated test data creation to comply with `required` properties in entities and DTOs.

## Rationale

The migration aimed to bring `Maliev.MessageService` in line with modern .NET development standards, improve maintainability, testability, and security, and ensure consistency with other services. By adopting DTOs, a service layer, and externalized secret management, the project is now more robust, scalable, and easier to deploy in a cloud-native environment. The refactoring of tests to use mocking further enhances the testability and reliability of the codebase.

## Important Considerations

*   **Secrets in Google Secret Manager**: Ensure the `ConnectionStrings-MessageServiceDbContext` secret is correctly configured in Google Secret Manager before deployment.
*   **Local Development Secrets**: For local development, use Visual Studio's User Secrets to manage sensitive information.
*   **Build and Test**: Always run `dotnet build` and `dotnet test` after any changes to ensure project integrity.
